(* parametrized line through two points *)
x = (1-t) x0 + t x1
y = (1-t) y0 + t y1
z = (1-t) z0 + t z1

(* elliptic curve *)
p[x_, y_, z_] := z y^2 - x^3 - a x z^2 - b z^3

(* inserting the line into the elliptic curve should give a third
   solution besides 0 and 1, so the quotient by t (t-1) should
   be linear, giving a formula for t *)
